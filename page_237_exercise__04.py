Program: Describe how a row-major traversal visits every position in a two-dimensional grid
Solution:
-In a row-major traversal, the outer loop of this structure moves down the rows using the y-coordinate,
and the inner loop moves across the columns using the x-coordinate. Each column in a row is visited before moving to the next row.
A column-major traversal reverses these settings.

Problem: List four phases of the software development process, and explain what they
accomplish
Solution:
    Describe the basic phases of software development:
    1: analysis,
    2: design,
    3: coding,
    4: testing
    The waterfall model consists of several phases:
    1. Customer request—In this phase, the programmers receive a broad statement of
    a problem that is potentially amenable to a computerized solution. This step is also
    called the user requirements phase.
    2. analysis—The programmers determine what the program will do. This is sometimes viewed as a process of clarifying the specifications for the problem.
    3. Design—The programmers determine how the program will do its task.
    4. Implementation—The programmers write the program. This step is also called the
    coding phase.
    5. Integration—Large programs have many parts. In the integration phase, these parts
    are brought together into a smoothly functioning whole, usually not an easy task.
    6. Maintenance—Programs usually have a long life; a life span of 5 to 15 years is common for software. During this time, requirements change, errors are detected, and
    minor or major modifications are made.

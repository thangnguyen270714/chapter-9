Problem: How does a Python programmer round a float value to the nearest int value?
Solution:
    Note that the int function converts a float to an int by truncation, not by rounding to the
nearest whole number. Truncation simply chops off the numberâ€™s fractional part. The round
function rounds a float to the nearest int as in the next example:
#int(6.75)
6
#round(6.75)
7
    ....

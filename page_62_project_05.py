Problem: An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program
that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as
inputs and then outputs its momentum.
Solution:
    ....
"""
# Request the inputs
mass=float(input('Nhap khoi luong:'))
velocity=float(input('Nhap van toc:'))
# Compute the results
momentum=mass*velocity
# Display the the results
print('Quan Tinh =',momentum)

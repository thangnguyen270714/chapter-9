Problem: Light travels at 3**108 meters per second. A light-year is the distance a light beam
travels in one year. Write a program that calculates and displays the value of a
light-year
Solution:
    useful facts:
    rate=3*10**8
    seconds in year=365*24*60**2
    ....
"""
# Compute the results
rate=3*10**8
seconds=365*24*60**2
distance=rate*seconds
# Display the the results
print('The distance a light beam travels in one year:',distance)

Problem: Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a
    function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument
    and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main
    function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses
    the enter/return key
Solution:

"""
import math

# Initialize the tolerance
SAISO = 0.000001

def newton(x):
    """Returns the square root of x"""
    estimate = 1.0
    while True:
        estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
        difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
        if difference <= SAISO:
            break
    return estimate
if __name__ == '__main__':
    """Allows the user to obtain square roots"""
    while True:
        #Receive the input number from the user
        x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:")
        if x == "":
            break
        x = float(x)
        print("The program's estimate is: ", newton(x))
        print("Python's estimate is ", math.sqrt(x))

Problem: Octal numbers have a base of eight and the digits 0â€“7. Write the scripts octalToDecimal.py and decimalToOctal.py
    , which convert numbers between the octal and decimal representations of integers. These scripts use algorithms that are
    similar to those of the binaryToDecimal and decimalToBinary scripts developed in Section 4-3.
Solution:
    ....
"""
# octalToDecimal.py
#input
o_t_n=int(input('Enter a string of octal digits: '))
#required variables
i = 1
dc = 0
#loop for conversion
while (o_t_n != 0):
#to find remainder
    rmd = o_t_n % 10
    o_t_n //= 10
    dc += rmd * i
    i *= 8
#print the results
print('The integer value is ',dc)

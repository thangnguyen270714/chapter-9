Problem:Explain the role of the trailing else part of an extended if statement
Solution:
    The if-else statement is the most common type of selection statement. It is also called a
two-way selection statement, because it directs the computer to make a choice between
two alternative courses of action.
The if-else statement is often used to check inputs for errors and to respond with error
messages if necessary. The alternative is to go ahead and perform the computation if the
inputs are valid.

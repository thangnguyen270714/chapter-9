Problem: Elena complains that the recursive newton function in Project 2 includes an extra
    argument for the estimate. The functionâ€™s users should not have to provide this
    value, which is always the same, when they call this function. Modify the definition of the function so that
    it uses a keyword argument with the appropriate default value, and call the function without a second
    argument to demonstrate that it solves this problem.
Solution:

"""
import math

# Initialize the tolerance
tolerance = 0.000001

def newton(x, estimate = 1):
    """Returns the square root of x"""
    # Compute the difference and test for the base case
    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
    if difference <= tolerance:
        return estimate
    else:
        # Recurse after improving the estimate
        return newton(x, (estimate + x / estimate) /2)

def main():
    """Allows the user to obtain square roots"""
    while True:
        # Receive the input number from the user
        x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:")
        if x == "":
            break
        x = float(x)
        # Output the result
        print("The program's estimate is: ", newton(x))
        print("Python's estimate is ", math.sqrt(x))

main()

Problem: Elena complains that the recursive newton function in Project 2 includes an extra
    argument for the estimate. The function’s users should not have to provide this
    value, which is always the same, when they call this function. Modify the definition of the function so that
    it uses a keyword argument with the appropriate default value, and call the function without a second
    argument to demonstrate that it solves this problem.
Solution:

"""
import math

# Initialize the tolerance
tolerance = 0.000001

def newton(x, estimate = 1):
    """Returns the square root of x"""
    # Compute the difference and test for the base case
    difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
    if difference <= tolerance:
        return estimate
    else:
        # Recurse after improving the estimate
        return newton(x, (estimate + x / estimate) /2)

def main():
    """Allows the user to obtain square roots"""
    while True:
        # Receive the input number from the user
        x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:")
        if x == "":
            break
        x = float(x)
        # Output the result
        print("The program's estimate is: ", newton(x))
        print("Python's estimate is ", math.sqrt(x))

main()

Problem: Explain the role of the variable in the header of a for loop.
Solution:
    The first line of code in a loop is sometimes called the loop header. For now, the only relevant information in the header is the integer expression, which denotes the number of
iterations that the loop performs. The colon (:) ends the loop header. The loop body comprises the statements in the remaining lines of code, below the header. These statements are
executed in sequence on each pass through the loop. Note that the statements in the loop
body must be indented and aligned in the same column. The IDLE shell or script window
will automatically indent lines under a loop header, but you may see syntax errors if this
indentation is off by even one space. It is best to indent four spaces if the indentation does
not automatically occur when you move to the next line of code.
